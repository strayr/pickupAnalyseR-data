# pickupAnalyseR-data
This contains datasets for use with pickupAnalyser. They are measurements made of guitar pickups using a vector network analyser. The goal is tobe able to accurately compare the frequency responses of these pickups to aid in pickup selection.

The files are of the form 
FOO-UL.csv #tested without load
FOO-LD.csv #tested with 200kOhm and 470pF load
FOO-IT.csv #tested with 100nF capacitor in order to calculate inductance.

Note also the infixes that may denote wire colour (WG,BR etc) or whether a coil in a humbucker has SLUG or SCREW poles.
